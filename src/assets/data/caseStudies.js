    employees engaged in construction projects across the country, faced several
    critical challenges in managing their human resources efficiently. The

  <p><strong>Employee Mobility and Historical Records</strong></p>
  <p>
    Dinco&#39;s large workforce frequently moved between construction projects.
    This mobility created challenges in maintaining and tracking historical work
    records and personnel information, leading to inefficiencies and potential
    data errors.
  </p>
  </br>

  <p><strong>Performance Reviews</strong></p>
  <p>
    Dinco lacked a centralized system for managing performance reviews, which

    systematically. This absence of structured performance insights impacted the
    company&#39;s overall productivity.
  </p>
  </br>

  <p><strong>Time-Consuming Payroll Processing</strong></p>
  <p>
    With numerous projects located across different geographical areas,
